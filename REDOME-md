🌷 Another Stories Intimates Admin

A feminine, poetic approach to retail management —
because even closing numbers can tell a beautiful story.

🩰 Overview

Another Stories Intimates Admin is a concept admin system inspired by the lingerie brand Love Stories.
It’s designed for boutique staff and managers who value beauty, warmth, and emotional connection — even in everyday tasks like reporting sales or managing shifts.

This project reimagines the admin dashboard as a soft, human workspace — elegant, intuitive, and emotionally engaging.

✨ Concept

Unlike typical admin tools that feel mechanical or cold,
this interface invites users to pause, reflect, and record their “daily story.”
It blends functional clarity with a sense of intimacy,
transforming daily management into a personal ritual.

🕊️ Because behind every number, there’s a story.
